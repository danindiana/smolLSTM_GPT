This code defines a simple feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is initialized with random weights, and the forward method computes the output given an input vector. The sigmoid function is used as the activation function for both layers.

To test the network, you can provide an input vector and print the output. Note that this implementation does not include training functionality, so the network won't learn from data. You'll need to implement a backpropagation algorithm and a training loop if you want to train the network to solve a specific problem.
